## Comments

Comments are parsed from `/**...*/` at the moment, later the aim is to support other styles of comment declarations.

## Description

Whilst many [tags](#tags) allow for a description parameter it is recommended that the description starts the comment:

```javascript
/**
 *  Module description.
 *
 *  @module ModuleName
 */
```
